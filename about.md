## Customer Vision  
  
>The problem that I would like to fix is that people forget to take their medicine. According to a study in 2012, 62% of people forget to take their medicine on a consistent basis.[1] I witnessed this personally when my great aunt had dementia and couldn't remember when or if she had taken her pills. My uncle lived about 30 minutes away and couldn"t go to her house every day to check if she had taken her medicine.
